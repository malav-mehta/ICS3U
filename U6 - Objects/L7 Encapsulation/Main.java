    // Question 1: Encapsulation protects the data or the methods of a class from
    // being accessed or viewed from outside of the class.

    // Question 2: An accessor method gives controlled access to certain fields of
    // the object. A mutator method gives controlled changes to certain fields of
    // the object. These are both accessible from outside the class.

    // Question 3: This statement is invalid, since the object s's i variable is
    // private. Hence, it cannot be accessed nor altered from outside of the class
    // without the use of an accessor or mutator method. So, this code would not work.
