	// 1. The fragment will output an error since the variable will not have
	// been initialized with any value.

	// 2. The following code should output:
	// s is |null|
	// t is ||
	// u is | |

	// 3. The fragment would print:
	// s is: Simple
	// t is: Sample

	// 4. The fragment would print:
	// s is: Second
	// t is: First

	// 5. This means that the value of a string cannot be change. Rather,
	// when a new value is assigned to a pre-existing string, it is its
	// reference that is changed. For example, running the function
	// "s.substring(x)" will not change the value of the string s, but
	// rather return a new string with the corresponding substring.
	// This means that the value of the string cannot be changed directly,
	// it must be replaced altogether.

	// 6. Yes. In this case, the string itself isn't being change, it is
	// being replaced by a new value.
